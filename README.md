# Real-Time-Video-Effect

## Project Description
Today, it is fashionable to post videos on social networks. And videos with some special effect are likely to draw more attention than the other.  As people enjoy watching the effect while recording the video than applying afterward, real-time video effect are crucial for the need of social media.

In this project, we plan to build software that can apply multi special effects on video in real time. We want to implement effects such as some basic style filters and animation style filters. The basic filters will be based on some existing filters in OpenCV. And we will write our own animation style filter. In this filter, we will use some image fragmentation algorithm so that we can apply different parameters to different parts of the frame.
